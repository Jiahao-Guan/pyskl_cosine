# pyskl_cosine

Our research is based on PYSKL, and you can learn more about PYSKL at https://github.com/kennymckormick/pyskl.



## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kennymckormick/pyskl.git
cd pyskl
# This command runs well with conda 22.9.0, if you are running an early conda version and got some errors, try to update your conda first
conda env create -f pyskl.yaml
conda activate pyskl
pip install -e .
```

## Data Preparation
For the cosine stream, we recommend generating cosine data in advance using the provided data transform script. This can help save time.

## Training & Testing

You can use following commands for training and testing. Basically, we support distributed training on a single server with multiple GPUs.
```shell
# Training
bash tools/dist_train.sh {config_name} {num_gpus} {other_options}
# Testing
bash tools/dist_test.sh {config_name} {checkpoint} {num_gpus} --out {output_file} --eval top_k_accuracy mean_class_accuracy
```
For specific examples, please go to the README for each specific algorithm we supported.
